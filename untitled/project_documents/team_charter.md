### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    *This is a judgement free zone - we'd rather know if someone is struggling,
    before it becomes a large issue. It's a team project, we will get through this together.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    *Bring it up with the other members of the group, or if if you don't feel safe doing that, contact Tom.*  

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
     *Setting regular group calls to go over what we've accomplished, and to make sure things are up to par.
    Also, we will set goals and deadlines to ensure that work is being accomplished in a timely manner. 

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
     *If a deadline is going to be missed, notify the team beforehand so that we can address a plan to make sure the work gets done in time.*

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
     *Specifically assigned tasks for each group member via trello or some other time keeping platform*


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
    *Apply what we've learned to create a project worthy of being used as an example of our skills in a job interview, as well as further our skills in a team environment.*


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
    *Our goal is to create a MVP (minimum viable product), and this is our priority. After that, our goal is to improve the front end look, and adding additional features if time permits*


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
    *How to construct a product from scratch, as well as front end skills*


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
    *daily check-in meetings, group coding sessions, and setting consistent benchmarks*
